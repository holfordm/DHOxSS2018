# Transcribing and encoding primary sources

I
During the first part of this workshop, I will walk you through the most important TEI elements used in text transcription. 

As we go along, you will be using the elements to annotate a a passage from [Isaac Newton's notebooks](http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-03996/210), digitized by Cambridge University Library. 
The library provides transcriptions of this page created by the Newton Project, which you can view by clicking the 'View more options' tab on the right of the screen: one transcription is 'diplomatic', 
representing the manuscript as closely as possible; the other provides a slightly normalized view. (This is a typical illustration of how the same TEI-XML can be used to generate two different views of a text.)

The passage we will encode is the second paragraph, beginning 'Light cannot...'. A plain-text transcription of this passage, based on the diplomatic transcription, is provided as 'Newton-notebook-text.xml'. 

At the end of this part of the workshop, you will have a change to review your encoding against that produced by the Newton Project: the Newton project markup is provided as 'Newton-notebook-markup.xml'.

II
In the second part of the workshop, you will work independently to encode a passage from one of the primary sources we looked at on Monday.
