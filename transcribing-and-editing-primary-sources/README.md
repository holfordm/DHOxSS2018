# Transcribing and encoding primary sources

## I

During the first part of this workshop, we will walk through the most important TEI elements used in text transcription and documentary editing. 

As we go along, you will be using the elements to annotate a a passage from [Isaac Newton's notebooks](http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-03996/210), digitized by Cambridge University Library. 
The library provides transcriptions of this page created by the Newton Project, which you can view by clicking the 'View more options' tab on the right of the screen: one transcription is 'diplomatic', 
representing the manuscript as closely as possible; the other provides a slightly normalized view. (This is a typical illustration of how the same TEI-XML can be used to generate two different views of a text.)

The passage we will encode is the second paragraph, beginning 'Light cannot...'. A plain-text transcription of this passage, based on the diplomatic transcription, is provided as 'Newton-notebook-text.xml'. 

At the end of this part of the workshop, you will have a change to review your encoding against that produced by the Newton Project: the Newton project markup is provided as 'Newton-notebook-markup.xml'.

## II

In the second part of the workshop - if time permits - you will work independently to encode a passage from one of the following sources:

- Ashmolean Museum ANChandler.3.62, the epitaph of Pontia Telesphoridis. Image and transcription can be found at [The Ashmolean Latin Inscriptions Project](http://latininscriptions.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/xml/AN_Chandler_3_62.xml). To see the project TEI and review your work, use the "View Page Source" function on your browser.
- Shelley's 'Hymn to Intellectual Beauty'. Image and transcription at the [Shelley-Godwin archive](http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/sc/bl/hymn_to_intellectual_beauty/#/p1). To see the project's TEI and review your work, click the box with the angle-bracket symbol above the document image.
- Langland's Piers Plowman, B.18.42ff, from MS. Laud Misc. 581, fol. 77r; transcription and image at the [Piers Plowman Electronic Archive](http://piers.chass.ncsu.edu/texts/L/18?view=all#77r). To see the image, click the 'I' by the 'fol. 77r' heading. To see the PPEA TEI and review your work, click 'download XML' in the upper right corner of the screen.
- The Digby 'Conversion of Paul', fol. 37r: image [here](https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/viewer/4028b70a-83d5-4192-857d-3b6c2ffd021a#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=71&r=0&xywh=-60%2C-1%2C2439%2C3072), transcription (Furnivall's edition) [here](https://archive.org/stream/digbyplayswitha00furngoog#page/n71/mode/1up)
