# Describing primary sources

## I

During the first part of this workshop, I will walk you through the most important TEI elements used for describing text-bearing objects, in particular (but not exclusively) Western manuscripts. 

As we go along, you will be using the elements to create a description of MS. Laud Misc. 581, the manuscript of _Piers Plowman_ that we looked at on Monday. 
A prose description of the manuscript can be found at the (Piers Plowman Electronic Archive)[http://piers.chass.ncsu.edu/texts/L/intro]. 
To create a template manuscript description in Oxygen, select File > New > Framework templates > TEI P5 > Manuscript description


## II

In the second part of the workshop, you will work independently to create a description of another primary source.
