# Describing primary sources

## I

During the first part of this workshop, we will walk through the most important TEI elements used for describing text-bearing objects, in particular (but not exclusively) Western manuscripts. 

As we go along, you will be using the elements to create a description of a text bearing object from the following list:

- MS. Laud Misc. 581 (the manuscript of _Piers Plowman_ that we looked at on Monday). A prose description of the manuscript can be found at the [Piers Plowman Electronic Archive](http://piers.chass.ncsu.edu/texts/L/intro). 
- Ashmolean Museum ANChandler.3.62, the epitaph of Pontia Telesphoridis. A prose description is at the [Ashmolean Latin Inscriptions Project](http://latininscriptions.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/xml/AN_Chandler_3_62.xml) 
- a letter of William Blake, 12 April 1827. Description at the [Blake Archive](http://www.blakearchive.org/copy/letters?descId=lt12april1827.1.ltr.01) [click on the 'Letter information' tab underneath the image]

## II

You can review your markup against the Ashmolean's description in EpiDoc TEI (use your browser's "View Source" function on the page above) and the Blake Archive's description in an XML standard related to TEI [here](http://www.blakearchive.org/bad/lt12april1827.1.xml)


## III

In the second part of the workshop - if time permits - you will work independently to create a description of one of the other sources listed above.
